# Finding Elements of Text with NLP in Java [Video]
This is the code repository for [Finding Elements of Text with NLP in Java [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/finding-elements-text-nlp-java-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788475754), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is used in many applications to provide capabilities that were previously not possible. It involves analyzing text to obtain intent and meaning, which can then be used to support an application. 

Using NLP within an application requires a combination of standard Java techniques and often specialized libraries frequently based on models that have been trained. Developers need to know what is available, how these technologies can be used, and when they should be used. 

This video course will start by building on the basic NLP tasks of data normalization, tokenization, and SBD to perform more specialized NLP tasks. You will be able to do more than simply find a word in the text. Also, identify specific elements such as a personâ€™s name or a location from the text. 

Learn to split a sentence into basic grammatical units is another task that enables you to extract meaning and relationships from text. Towards the end of this course, you will also be able to classify text and determine the intent of the text.
